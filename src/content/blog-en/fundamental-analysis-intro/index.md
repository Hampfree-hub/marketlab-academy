Fundamental analysis helps you see whether an asset is worth your attention and whether the market is overheated. In crypto there are no IFRS reports, but there are on-chain metrics, tokenomics, and macro. This article covers how FA in crypto differs from the classic approach and how to combine it with technical analysis.

## Intro: The cult of technical analysis and the blind spot of fundamentals

Most traders start with candles, levels, and indicators. Fundamentals feel “long and complicated.” Without them, you’re guessing on a fast-moving tape.

## What is fundamental analysis in the classic sense

For stocks: revenue, profit, multiples (P/E, P/S), dividends. For currencies: central bank rates, inflation, trade balance. FA answers “what to buy or hold,” not “where to enter to the pip.”

## How crypto fundamentals differ

No IFRS reports. Instead: technology and network architecture; on-chain metrics (MVRV, NVT, exchange reserves); tokenomics (emission, unlocks, vesting); team, community, regulatory backdrop. In stocks, fundamentals are “business and money”; in crypto, “network and incentives.”

## Fundamental vs technical: how they work together

FA answers: “Is this asset worth attention?” “Are we closer to overheated or undervalued?” TA answers: “Where exactly to enter or exit in the next days or weeks?” Example: FA shows a bullish on-chain regime → TA looks for long setups.

## Framework: 3 steps for a trader

1. Macro and narrative (rates, regulation, current market “stories”).
2. Asset quality (top coins vs shitcoins; technology, tokenomics).
3. On-chain cycle context (MVRV, exchange reserves, network activity).

## Conclusion

In 2026, ignoring fundamentals is a luxury. A trader who understands FA selects assets better and tells “pump for the sake of pump” from a real trend.
