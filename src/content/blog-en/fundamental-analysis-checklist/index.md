From “it’s too complex” to “I have a 15-minute checklist.” The goal is to quickly run through a token and decide whether to dig deeper or not. The checklist does not replace a deep dive but helps filter out what isn’t worth looking at on the chart. For an introduction to fundamental analysis and how it fits with technical analysis, see the [overview article](/en/library/fundamental-analysis-intro/).

## Step 1. Basic asset info (about 5 minutes)

**What to check:** what problem the project solves (use case), where the token trades, liquidity and volume.

**Why:** if the token trades on one obscure exchange with tiny volume, order execution and exiting a position can be a problem. Market cap and volume show whether it’s worth your time for the next step or the asset is too small for your risk.

**Practical:** go to CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap — exchanges, 24h volume, market cap. Assess whether liquidity is enough for your position size and whether price is being manipulated on a single venue.

## Step 2. Project and team (5–10 minutes)

**What to check:** website, whitepaper (if any), GitHub (open code and activity), team and partner visibility.

**Why:** projects with no clear product, anonymous team, and only marketing promises are higher risk. A live community, real partners, and a working product don’t guarantee profit but reduce the chance of a “rug.”

**Practical:** is there a clear problem and solution; is the code updated; are founders’ names and socials listed; are there partnerships with known projects or companies. Red flag — big claims with no proof.

## Step 3. Tokenomics and “rug” risks (10–15 minutes)

**What to check:** max supply, emission model (inflation or deflation), vesting and allocations (who gets how much and when it unlocks). Any large unlocks in the next few months; is allocation skewed toward team and funds. Does the token have real utility in the product.

**Why:** mass unlock to team or funds increases supply and often pushes price down. If most tokens sit in few wallets and unlock is soon, risk for buyers is higher. For more on on-chain metrics and coin flows, see the [on-chain metrics article](/en/library/onchain-metrics-fundamental-analysis/).

**Practical:** check unlock schedules (Token Unlocks, analytics services). Assess share held by team, funds, marketing. Understand whether the token is needed for the network/product or only for speculation.

## Step 4. Basic on-chain metrics as a filter

**What to check:** active addresses, on-chain transaction volume, concentration in large holders (whales), exchange reserves.

**Why:** price rising while network activity falls and coins move “to wallets” can be less sustainable. Rising active addresses and usage with reasonable concentration is a sign of interest in the network, not just price. Data is available from Glassnode, CryptoQuant, Dune and similar services.

**Practical:** compare price trend and active-address/volume trend; see whether exchange reserves are rising or falling (inflow to exchanges often precedes selling pressure). Don’t conclude from one metric — look at them together.

## Step 5. Red flags

**What may indicate higher risk:**

- **Pump-style tokenomics** — huge share with team/marketing, unlocks soon, no clear token utility.
- **Opaque team** — anonymous, fake LinkedIn, no project history.
- **Aggressive marketing with no product** — “X100,” “next Bitcoin” promises, no working app or contracts.
- **Suspicious smart contracts** — ability to “freeze” user funds, hidden fees, contract not verified or closed-source.

One red flag is reason for caution; several — better not to enter or to cap position size. For more on risk and capital protection, see [risk management in crypto trading](/en/library/risk-management-crypto-trading-bots/).

## Conclusion

Here fundamentals are a junk filter and setup amplifier: filter out what isn’t worth looking at on the chart and understand context for the rest. The goal isn’t to know everything about every token but to quickly check key points and decide: dig deeper or skip.

## FAQ

**How long does the checklist take in practice?**  
First run — 15–20 minutes. Once you’re used to the data sources — 10–15 minutes per token.

**Can I skip on-chain metrics?**  
Yes, for a first filter steps 1–3 (basic info, project, tokenomics) are enough. On-chain adds cycle context and large-holder behavior; useful for a deeper pass — see [on-chain metrics in FA](/en/library/onchain-metrics-fundamental-analysis/).

**What to do after the checklist?**  
If the token passed the filter — move to technical analysis for entry: levels, indicators, volume. If not — either skip or strictly limit position size and stop loss.
