<!-- Stub 31.01. Practical article per FUNDAMENTAL_ANALISYS_DEMO.md §2 -->

From “it’s too complex” to “I have a 15-minute checklist.” After this article you can quickly scan a token and decide whether to dig deeper.

## Step 1. Basic asset info (5 minutes)

What problem or use case? Where it trades (exchanges, liquidity, volume). Market cap and volume — is it worth your time.

## Step 2. Project and team (5–10 minutes)

Website, whitepaper, GitHub, team visibility. Does the project solve a real problem? Is there a real community, partners, product?

## Step 3. Tokenomics and “rug” risks (10–15 minutes)

Max supply, model (inflation/deflation), vesting, allocations. Any big unlocks in the next few months? Is allocation skewed toward fund/team? Real utility for the token?

## Step 4. Basic on-chain metrics as a filter

Active addresses, transaction volume, whale concentration, exchange reserves. Is network usage and interest growing, not just price?

## Step 5. Red flags

Ponzi-like tokenomics, opaque team, aggressive marketing with no product, “X100 promises,” suspicious smart contracts.

## Conclusion

Fundamentals as a junk filter and a setup amplifier. The goal isn’t to know everything, but to quickly filter out what isn’t worth looking at on the chart.
