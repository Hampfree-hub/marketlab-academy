A **stablecoin** is a cryptocurrency whose price is pegged to an external reference — most commonly the US dollar (1:1). Unlike Bitcoin or Ether, a stablecoin’s price is designed to fluctuate much less, which makes it useful for payments, savings, and transfers without direct exposure to crypto volatility.

## Why stablecoins exist

On the crypto market, stablecoins are used for:

- **Payments and transfers:** sending value without big exchange-rate swings.
- **Storage inside crypto rails:** holding USD-like value without converting back to fiat.
- **Trading:** quickly moving to a “safe harbor” during drawdowns.
- **Yield:** lending / DeFi strategies while keeping USD-denominated exposure.

## How the peg is maintained

**Fiat-backed (USDT, USDC):** the issuer holds reserves in dollars or equivalents. Tokens are minted when funds are received and redeemed when funds are withdrawn.

**Crypto-collateralized (DAI):** tokens are minted against collateral like ETH and other assets. Over-collateralization and protocol mechanisms aim to keep the peg stable.

**Algorithmic (historically):** supply/demand is balanced by algorithms without direct collateral. These models have shown high risk during sharp market moves.

## Major stablecoins

**USDT (Tether):** the largest by volume. The issuer publishes reserve reports; historically criticized for reserve transparency.

**USDC (Circle):** reserves are held in cash and US Treasuries, with regular attestations. Often used in more regulated products.

**DAI (Maker):** decentralized, backed by crypto collateral. The peg is maintained by the Maker protocol without a single centralized issuer.

## Key risks

- **Reserves / backing:** whether the assets behind tokens are real and liquid (especially for centralized issuers).
- **Regulation:** restrictions on issuers or usage can impact availability.
- **Smart-contract risk (DeFi):** bugs, exploits, and protocol failures.

Stablecoins are a core piece of the crypto ecosystem: they connect crypto rails to fiat value and make trading and DeFi more practical.
