**Tokenomics** is the set of rules that define a crypto project’s economy: how many tokens exist, how they are distributed, how they are used, and what affects their price. Understanding tokenomics helps you evaluate sustainability and investor risk.

## Why tokenomics matters

A token can serve different roles: access to a product, governance voting, staking rewards, or paying fees. Tokenomics connects these pieces and answers a practical question: **who receives tokens, when, and under which conditions**.

Key components:

- **Supply / emissions:** total supply cap (or no cap), how tokens are minted (up-front, gradually, mining, staking, etc.).
- **Distribution:** share allocated to the team, investors, community, and ecosystem funds — plus *when* those tokens can hit the market.
- **Utility:** what the token is used for (fees, staking, governance, discounts). Utility drives real demand beyond speculation.

## Core metrics

**Market cap:** token price × circulating supply. A snapshot of how the market values the project today.

**FDV (Fully Diluted Valuation):** token price × max supply (if all tokens are issued). Helps estimate “fully unlocked” valuation.

**Circulating supply:** tokens currently available on the market (often smaller than max supply).

**Unlock schedule:** a calendar of token releases for team/investors/ecosystem — sharp unlocks can create sell pressure.

## What to check when analyzing a project

- allocation to team/investors and vesting/unlock timelines
- whether there are deflationary mechanisms (burns) or staking that reduces effective supply
- whether the token has real product utility (not only “number go up”)
- FDV vs comparable projects and realistic adoption potential

Tokenomics is one piece of fundamental analysis. It should be evaluated together with the product, the team, and market conditions. For basics: **[Bitcoin Basics](/en/library/bitcoin-basics)** and **[What Is Digital Currency?](/en/library/what-is-digital-currency-in-simple-terms)**.
