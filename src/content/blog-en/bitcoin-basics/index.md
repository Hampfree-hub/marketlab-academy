Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency in the world. Created by an anonymous developer under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, it introduced blockchain technology to the world.

## Why does it matter?

Bitcoin allows value to be transferred without the involvement of intermediaries such as banks or governments. It is a decentralized system based on mathematics and cryptography.

### Key characteristics:
1. **Limited supply:** Only 21 million coins will ever be created.
2. **Decentralization:** No one controls the network.
3. **Transparency:** All transactions are recorded in a public ledger.
