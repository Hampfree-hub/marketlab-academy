Digital currency is money that exists only in electronic form. Unlike cash and coins, it has no physical form and is used over the internet, mobile apps, and digital wallets.

## How digital money differs from traditional money

The main difference is the form it takes:
- **Traditional money:** banknotes, coins, and balances in bank accounts.
- **Digital currency:** fully intangible, existing only in digital systems.

Many of today’s digital assets are built on blockchain — a distributed ledger that provides transparency and protection against forgery. Governments are rolling out their own projects, such as digital ruble, digital yuan, or digital euro, to complement existing payment systems.

## Types of digital currency

Digital money falls into three main groups:

1. **Decentralized cryptocurrencies:** Run by users and algorithms (e.g. [Bitcoin](/en/library/bitcoin-basics/)).
2. **Central bank digital currencies (CBDC):** Issued by central banks and legal tender.
3. **Corporate digital money:** In-house currencies of platforms or payment systems.

## How it works

Most modern digital currencies rest on blockchain: a decentralized database where each transaction is recorded in cryptographically secured blocks.

For **CBDC**, control is often through a central bank’s centralized platform, integrated into retail payments. Users access funds via dedicated digital wallets.

## Advantages of digital currency

Digitizing finance brings clear benefits:
- **Speed:** Near-instant transfers anywhere in the world.
- **Cost:** Lower fees by cutting out intermediaries.
- **Transparency:** Ability to trace each unit of value (useful for fighting corruption).
- **Security:** Strong protection against forgery thanks to cryptography.
- **Programmability:** “Smart money” for automatic execution of contracts.

## Why it’s the future of finance

The world is moving away from cash. Younger generations prefer QR and mobile payments to traditional banking. Governments see digital currencies as easier to control, regulate, and use for targeted support.

Already in progress:
- **Digital yuan (e-CNY):** The largest state-level project.
- **Digital ruble:** Russia is testing a platform for retail and wholesale payments.
- **Digital euro:** The EU is preparing for launch in the coming years.

## FAQ

**Is digital currency the same as cryptocurrency?**  
No. Cryptocurrency is decentralized and has no single issuer. Digital currency can be centralized (e.g. CBDC) and issued by the state.

**How safe are digital currencies?**  
Blockchain and modern cryptography provide strong protection. Safety also depends on the user: securing private keys and using two-factor authentication.

**Will digital currency replace cash?**  
In the long run, likely. In the near term they will coexist as complementary forms of money.
