# Rising Wedge in Trading: What It Is and How to Use It

In technical analysis, the rising wedge is one of the main bearish patterns that can signal a potential reversal of an uptrend. Understanding it and using it correctly can improve both discretionary and algorithmic trading.

## Definition and Visual Traits

A rising wedge is a chart pattern formed by two converging trendlines, both sloping up. The support line (lower boundary) has a steeper slope than the resistance line (upper boundary). This indicates slowing upward momentum and possible exhaustion of the bullish move.

Main visual traits:

- Gradual narrowing of the price range.
- A sequence of higher highs and higher lows.
- Declining volume as the pattern develops.

## How It Differs From Other Patterns

Unlike a price channel, where support and resistance are parallel, the rising wedge has converging lines. The narrowing suggests lower volatility and a possible trend change. In a channel, price moves within a stable range; in a wedge, upward movement tends to slow.

## How a Rising Wedge Forms

It typically appears after a sustained uptrend. As price moves higher, momentum fades, with highs rising more slowly than lows. The range narrows and a wedge-shaped structure forms. Lower volume during this phase supports the idea of weaker buying and a higher chance of a reversal.

## Meaning of the Rising Wedge

In technical analysis, patterns imply possible future outcomes. The rising wedge is mostly treated as a bearish signal.

### Bearish Signal

The rising wedge is often seen as bearish, especially when it forms after a prolonged uptrend. A break below the lower support line, preferably on higher volume, confirms a reversal and suggests the start of a downtrend. Traders use this to open shorts or take profit on longs.

## Trading Examples

### On the Spot Market

In crypto spot markets (e.g. BTC/USD), a rising wedge can warn of a correction after a long rally. Traders holding the asset may prepare for a pullback by setting stop-losses or opening shorts after a confirmed break.

### On Futures and Leverage

With futures or leverage, the rising wedge becomes even more important. It can be traded for a bounce (long) or a breakout (short). Because of higher risk, recognising the pattern early and adjusting positions (e.g. closing or adding protective orders) helps limit losses.

## Rising Wedge and Trading Bots

In volatile crypto markets, bots are increasingly used. Many can detect chart patterns, including the rising wedge, and place trades automatically.

Understanding and using the rising wedge correctly can improve trading results. It can be combined with other tools, such as the [RSI](/en/library/technical-analysis-rsi/) or [doji candles](/en/library/what-are-doji-candles/), for better timing.
