You can start trading crypto even with a small amount. Many beginners think they need a large bankroll, but the key is not the size of capital — it’s **risk management**, realistic expectations, and choosing strategies that match your constraints.

This draft explains practical principles for small deposits and simple strategies that are safer for beginners.

## Can you trade with a small deposit?

Yes. But trading with a small balance has constraints:

- you can’t open large positions
- fees can matter more as a share of small trades — worth considering when choosing an exchange and trade frequency
- diversification is harder

There are also benefits:

- lower psychological pressure
- learning with smaller mistakes
- forced discipline (you can’t “spray and pray”)

## Core principles

### 1) Limit risk per trade / idea

Many guides suggest risking no more than 1–2% per trade. We use a different approach: capital spread across many assets and strategies, slightly higher risk per idea (~2.5%), but with diversification it has helped us through several corrections. Either way, set a clear limit per idea and stick to it — e.g. with $100, cap risk per idea at $2–3.

For our full approach see **[Risk Management for Crypto Trading Bots](/en/library/risk-management-crypto-trading-bots)** (draft).

### 2) Start with conservative strategies

Beginner-friendly options:

- **DCA** (gradual entries / averaging with rules)
- **Grid / range trading** (best in sideways markets)
- **Long-term spot holding** (for top assets)

Avoid aggressive leverage strategies early on.

### 3) Prefer liquid, reliable assets

Top-cap assets usually have:

- higher liquidity
- lower relative volatility
- more stable behavior

Avoid illiquid microcaps when you’re learning.

### 4) Consider automation carefully

Bots can help:

- reduce emotions
- trade 24/7
- execute rules consistently

But bots don’t remove risk — they just execute your configuration.

## A simple $100 allocation example

Conservative starter idea:

- $50 reserved as a buffer
- $50 allocated to trading
  - $25 to higher-quality assets (e.g., BTC/ETH)
  - $25 to a small experimental sleeve with strict rules

Alternative (with bots):

- $50 buffer
- $50 split across several small bot instances (e.g., 5 × $10) to diversify execution
