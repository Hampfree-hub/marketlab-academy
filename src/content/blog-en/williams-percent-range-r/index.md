Many traders underuse the potential of the Williams %R oscillator. It helps identify trend exhaustion and entry points on reversals.

## What is the Williams %R indicator

**Williams %R** is a classic oscillator used to analyze price movement in financial markets. It helps identify overbought and oversold zones and possible reversal points. In cryptocurrency trading it is popular for its sensitivity to fast price changes.

## How it works

Williams %R compares the current closing price with the price range over a chosen period. It shows how close the current price is to the high or low of that range.

The indicator assumes that in an uptrend price tends toward the top of the range, and in a downtrend toward the bottom. Values range from 0 to -100:
- Values near **0** indicate overbought conditions.
- Values near **-100** indicate oversold conditions.

It is a leading tool: it reacts to price changes faster than many other oscillators, which helps prepare for possible trend reversals in volatile markets.

## Williams %R formula

The formula is:
`%R = (Highest High - Close) / (Highest High - Lowest Low) × (-100)`

This highlights potential reversal points by measuring where price sits within its recent range.

## Interpreting the readings

Two levels are commonly used:
- **Above -20:** market is considered overbought. Price is in the upper part of the range and the risk of a pullback increases.
- **Below -80:** market is considered oversold. The asset is in the lower part of the range, which often precedes a bounce.

Being in extreme zones is not an automatic trade signal. Many traders wait for the line to leave these zones to confirm a change in momentum.

## Buy and sell signals

Williams %R generates signals when leaving extreme zones:

- **Buy signal:** when the indicator crosses above -80 from below. The asset is starting to recover after heavy selling.
- **Sell signal:** when the indicator crosses below -20 from above. Buying pressure is fading.

## Combining Williams %R with other indicators

Because %R is leading, it can give false signals in strong trends. It is often combined with:

- **Williams %R + RSI:** filters false signals by comparing two oscillators.
- **Williams %R + EMA 50/200:** confirms signals in line with the longer-term trend.
- **Williams %R + volume indicators:** volume spikes on exits from overbought/oversold zones add confidence.
- **Williams %R + Bollinger Bands:** spots when price is at extreme distance from the average.

## Who Williams %R is for

It suits short- and medium-term traders (scalping, intraday). It works well in sideways markets and when looking for local pullbacks.

Beginners benefit from its simple interpretation, but need discipline when the market is in a strong directional move.
