Crypto staking is the process of locking your crypto assets in a blockchain network to help secure and operate the network and, in return, earn rewards. Staking is most common in **Proof of Stake (PoS)** and related consensus systems. Unlike mining, you don’t need special hardware — you mainly need the asset and a way to stake it.

## What is staking (simple explanation)

**Staking** is like earning interest by committing your coins to the network. Validators use staked funds as an economic guarantee: if they act maliciously or break consensus rules, they can be penalized (slashing).

In practice, staking rewards depend on:

- the network rules (inflation, fee distribution)
- the amount staked
- the staking method (solo validator vs delegated vs exchange staking)
- lock-up terms (if any)

## Why staking exists

Staking isn’t only about passive income — it supports:

- **Network security** (economic incentives to behave honestly)
- **Decentralization** (more participants validating)
- **Token economics** (staking can reduce circulating supply and smooth volatility)

## Main staking types

### 1) Centralized staking (via exchanges)

You stake through a platform (e.g., Binance/[Bybit](https://www.bybit.com/invite?ref=PWMD24)/OKX). The platform stakes on your behalf and shares rewards.

**Pros:**

- simplest for beginners
- usually one-click UX

**Cons:**

- custody risk (the platform holds your assets)
- platform rules/lock-ups

### 2) Delegated staking (on-chain)

You delegate tokens to a validator in your wallet. You keep custody, but you share rewards with the validator.

**Pros:**

- you keep control of your funds
- supports decentralization

**Cons:**

- smart UX varies by chain/wallet
- validator selection matters

### 3) Running your own validator

You operate a validator node yourself.

**Pros:**

- maximum control
- potentially higher net rewards

**Cons:**

- technical complexity
- uptime/security requirements

## Risks

- **Slashing risk:** validator penalties can reduce rewards or principal (depends on chain).
- **Lock-up / unbonding:** you may not be able to withdraw instantly.
- **Custody/platform risk:** if staking via an exchange.
- **Market risk:** the token price can drop even if you earn more tokens.

If you’re new, start small, prefer reputable networks/validators, and avoid locking funds you might need on short notice.
