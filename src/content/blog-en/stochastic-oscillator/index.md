<!-- Placeholder for ELDER 2.0 migration. Stochastic is one of three indicators (CMO, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic). Do not publish until filled. -->

The Stochastic Oscillator helps identify overbought and oversold conditions and time entries on pullbacks. In ELDER 2.0 it is used for entry (cross above 20) and exit (cross below 80).

**Structure (to fill):**

- What Stochastic is, author (George Lane), idea behind the indicator
- %K and %D lines: calculation and period settings
- Levels 20 (oversold) and 80 (overbought)
- Buy signal: %K and %D cross above 20
- Sell signal: %K and %D cross below 80
- Timeframes: in ELDER — M5 for entry, M15 for exit
- Combining with [CMO](/en/library/chande-momentum-oscillator/) and [Bollinger Bands](/en/library/bollinger-bands/)
- Brief: divergences, false signals in trends
