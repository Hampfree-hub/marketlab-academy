Understanding the difference between spot, margin, and futures trading is a core foundation for any crypto trader. Each instrument has its own mechanics, risks, and typical use cases.

## Spot Trading

Spot is the simplest and generally the safest form of trading. You buy the actual asset (for example, BTC or ETH), which becomes your property once the trade is settled. For a deeper dive, see our [guide to spot trading](/en/library/what-is-spot-trading/).

- **Ownership:** Purchased crypto can be withdrawn to your cold wallet.
- **No liquidation risk:** Even if the price drops 99%, your assets remain yours.
- **Suitable for:** Beginners, long-term investors, those who prefer stability.

## Margin Trading

Margin trading allows you to trade with borrowed funds — this is called leverage. For example, with 2x leverage on a $1,000 deposit, you can open a $2,000 position. If the price moves in your favor, your profit is calculated on the full $2,000, not just your $1,000. However, if the price moves against you, you can lose your entire deposit (liquidation).

- **Leverage:** 2x to 100x depending on the exchange and asset.
- **Liquidation risk:** If the price moves against your position, the position is automatically closed and you lose your deposit.
- **Suitable for:** Experienced traders with a high risk tolerance.

## Futures Trading

Futures are contracts to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specific future date. Unlike spot trading, you don't own the underlying asset — you're trading a derivative. Futures allow you to open both long (buy) and short (sell) positions, meaning you can profit from both rising and falling prices.

- **Settlement:** At expiration or continuously (perpetual contracts).
- **Leverage:** Often up to 100x.
- **Suitable for:** Advanced traders, arbitrageurs, hedgers.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Spot | Margin | Futures |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| Ownership | Yes | No (borrowed) | No |
| Leverage | No | 2-100x | Up to 100x |
| Liquidation | No | Yes | Yes |
| Direction | Long only | Long/Short | Long/Short |
| Risk Level | Low | High | Very High |

## Which to Choose

- **Beginners:** Start with spot trading.
- **Ready for more risk?** Try margin with 2-3x leverage.
- **Experienced and seeking profits in both directions?** Consider futures.
- **Always use** stop-losses and proper position sizing regardless of instrument.

## Conclusion

Each trading instrument has its place in a trader's toolkit. Spot trading provides safety and ownership, margin offers amplified gains (and losses), and futures provide flexibility to trade in any market direction. Start simple, learn the mechanics, and only then gradually move to more complex instruments with higher leverage.
