Understanding the difference between spot, margin, and futures trading is a core foundation for any crypto trader. Each instrument has its own mechanics, risks, and typical use cases.


## Spot Trading


Spot is the simplest and generally the safest form of trading. You buy the actual asset (for example, BTC or ETH), which becomes your property once the trade is settled. For a deeper dive, see our [guide to spot trading](/en/library/what-is-spot-trading/).


- **Ownership:** You can withdraw purchased crypto to your own cold wallet.  
- **Liquidation risk:** None. Even if the price drops 90%, you still hold the same number of coins.  
- **Leverage:** None. You trade only with your own capital.  
- **Primary goal:** Long-term investing and relatively safe accumulation.


For automating spot trading, our [ELDER 2.0 strategy](/en/library/spot-strategy-elder-20/) is an excellent fit.


## Margin Trading


Margin trading means using borrowed funds provided by the exchange to increase your position size.


- **Leverage:** You can open positions larger than your deposit (for example, 3x or 5x your capital).  
- **Liquidation risk:** Present. If the price moves against you far enough, the exchange can force-close your position.  
- **Interest:** You pay fees or interest to the exchange for borrowing funds.  
- **Primary goal:** Short-term boosting of potential returns on top of the spot market.


## Futures Trading


A futures contract is an agreement tied to the future price of an asset. You do not own the underlying coins; instead, you speculate on price movements.


- **Leverage:** Often up to 20x, 50x, or even 125x, depending on the platform and product.  
- **Liquidation risk:** Very high because of the large leverage typically used.  
- **Types:** Perpetual contracts and dated (delivery) futures.  
- **Funding:** A mechanism that keeps futures prices anchored to the spot market.  
- **Primary goal:** Speculating on both market rallies (long) and selloffs (short).

|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Asset ownership        | Yes                   | Yes (used as collateral)     | No (you trade contracts)         |
| Leverage               | No                    | Typically up to 5–10x        | Up to 100x+                      |
| Liquidation risk       | No                    | Yes                          | Yes                              |
| Shorting (bet on drop) | No                    | Yes                          | Yes                              |


## What Should You Choose?


1. **Investors:** Stick to spot only. It lets you ride out drawdowns without worrying about liquidation.  
2. **Experienced traders:** Margin or futures with low leverage for hedging existing positions.  
3. **Pure speculation:** Futures, since they are designed for leveraged long and short exposure on both trending and falling markets.


## Conclusion


The choice between spot, margin, and futures depends on your goals and risk tolerance. Investors are usually better off staying with spot, while active traders should thoroughly understand how leverage and liquidation work before using them.
