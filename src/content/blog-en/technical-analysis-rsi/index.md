# RSI Technical Analysis

Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100 and is traditionally used to identify overbought or oversold conditions.

## How it works?

Typically, a value above 70 indicates that an asset is overbought, while a value below 30 indicates it is oversold. However, in strong trending markets, RSI can remain in these zones for a long time.

### Key signals:
1. **Overbought/Oversold:** Return from extreme zones.
2. **Divergence:** Discrepancy between price direction and the indicator chart.
3. **Centerline Crossover (50):** Confirmation of a trend change.

At MarketLab, we use RSI as a supporting tool to filter false signals in our trading bots.
